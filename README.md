This is a module to manage the DUNDi configuration (stored in dundi.conf) of a FreePBX system.

If you are familiar with configuring DUNDi manually, the options here should require no explanation.

No changes are made to the dialplan except for two small contexts containing a list of DIDs and extensions. These can be disabled.
